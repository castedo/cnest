Conclusions
===========

Here are some conclusions the developer of `cnest` has made after
using the `cnest` tools since early 2020.

* It's useful to have an obvious symbol in the command line prompt giving a strong clue
  that one is inside a container

* It's very convenient to have `cnest` automatically stay in the directory when entering
  the container from the host while in a directory that is shared. It's
  annoying when this does not happen.

* It works well to be able to work with a complicated development environment as used by
  a larger development community using a common distro and common version of
  tools. This is in contrast to having to use a different distro and/or version of tools
  on one's own main system, potentially causing inter dependecy problems.

* It's convenient to have old tools stay on old distros while having one main system advance
  to a newer distro. Similarly, it's conveinent to leave one's main system as an older more
  stable release while will being able to try out and develop with less stable distros inside
  containers.
